# Warcraft Universalis
Warcraft Universalis is an ambitious project that attempts to recreate the Warcraft universe as we know it.

The aim of this mod is to recreate the lore from Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft series within Paradox Interactive's Europa Universalis 4 engine.

Allowing for a unique EU4 experience where the player does not simply play at altering the course of history but is in fact steeped in a whole other fictional universe filled with magic, demons, dragons and fantasy whilst retaining a very Europa Universalis feel. 

### Installing 
1. Download the latest release.
2. Go to **\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Europa Universalis IV\mod\**
3. Extract the files from the latest release into this directory.
	(So it should be **\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Europa Universalis IV\mod\warcraft_universalis\[extracted files] )
	(and **\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Europa Universalis IV\mod\warcraft_universalis.mod)
4. Launch Europa Universalis 4 and tick **Warcraft Universalis** under the Mod tab.
